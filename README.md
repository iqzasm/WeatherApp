# React Native boilerplate

## Steps to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npx react-native-rename "AppName" -b com.projectname.appname` to rename the whole project
   > **NOTE:** The only file not touched by the renaming is the _**LaunchScreen.storyboard**_
3. `npm install` and `npx pod-install` to install dependencies and update iOS specific packages
4. Update **.commitlintrc.js** with the JIRA project key
5. Now you can start with `npm run dev[:ios|:android]`
